# Assignment Description

This assignment involves running two scripts: `count_python.sh` and `count_github.py`. These scripts help in counting the number of Python files and GitHub repositories, respectively, in a given directory or from a GitHub account.

## Instructions

### Running the Scripts

1. **Running `count_python.sh`**:
   - Ensure the script has execute permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x count_python.sh
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     ./count_python.sh
     ```
   This script will count the number of Python files in the specified directory and output the result to a file named `python_count.txt`.

2. **Running `count_github.py`**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python3 count_github.py
     ```
   This script will fetch and count the number of repositories from your GitHub account and print the result to the terminal.
